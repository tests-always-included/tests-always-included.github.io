Quick Setup For Local Jekyll
============================

It is often handy to run Jekyll locally to test more complicated changes or diagnose problems.  It is not required for the documentation to update when you push changes.  In order to run Jekyll live locally you need to follow these steps.  A more detailed explanation is available from [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages).

1.  Make sure you have ruby 1.9.3 or 2.0.0.
2.  `gem install bundler`
3.  `bundle install`

To run the server you use `bundle exec jekyll serve` in the repository and go to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
